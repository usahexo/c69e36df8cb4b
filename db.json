It is a sub-specialty of paediatrics, which is the medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries in childhood.\n\n#\n\nPaediatric dentists have undergone special training in order to be able to provide dental care for children from birth right through to adolescence. They are experts in providing preventive dental care, as well as treating common childhood oral health problems such as tooth decay and gum disease.\n\n#\n\nIf you are looking for a dentist who can provide specialist care for your child’s teeth, then you should consider seeking out a paediatric dentist. Many general dentists also offer paediatric dental services, but it is best to check with them beforehand to ensure that they have experience in treating young patients.\n\n#  What are the benefits of paediatric dentistry?\n\nChildren who have good oral health and receive dental care when they are young are more likely to have healthy teeth and gums as adults. Good oral health is important for overall health, and paediatric dentistry provides the necessary dental care for children.\n\nOne benefit of paediatric dentistry is that it helps children develop a positive attitude towards dental care. When they are young, children should be seen by a paediatric dentist at least every six months. This will help them get used to visiting the dentist and having their teeth examined. Regular visits to the dentist can also help identify any potential problems early on, before they become serious.\n\nAnother benefit of paediatric dentistry is that it can help prevent tooth decay and other oral health problems. Tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease, so it’s important to get your child’s teeth checked regularly by a paediatric dentist. By doing so, you can help prevent your child from developing cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems.\n\nIf your child does need treatment for a dental problem, a paediatric dentist is equipped to provide it. Paediatric dentists have special training in treating children’s teeth and jaws, so they can provide the appropriate treatment for each child. This may include fillings, crowns, braces, or surgery if necessary.\n\nOverall, paediatric dentistry provides an important level of care for children’s oral health. It helps ensure that children have healthy teeth and gums which will last into adulthood.\n\n#  What is the difference between paediatric dentistry and regular dentistry?\n\nWhen it comes to paediatric dentistry, there is a difference between what paediatric dentists and regular dentists can do. For one, paediatric dentists have two years of additional training focused on caring for children’s teeth. They are also certified by the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry.\n\nThat means that paediatric dentists are experts in not only detecting and treating dental problems in children, but also in creating a positive experience for kids during their dental visits. They understand how to handle young patients and make them feel at ease.\n\nPaediatric dentists can also provide preventive care, such as fluoride treatments and dental sealants, which help protect children’s teeth from cavities. They can also provide guidance on how to care for your child’s teeth at home.\n\nIf you have a child who needs dental care, it’s important to seek out a qualified paediatric dentist. A good place to start is the American Academy of Pediatrics website.\n\n#  How do I know if my child needs to see a paediatric dentist?\n\nThere are various signs and symptoms which could suggest that your child needs to see a paediatric dentist. Some of these include:\n\n– Difficulty chewing or swallowing\n\n– Cramping or soreness in the jaw area\n\n– Persistent bad breath\n\n– Red, swollen, or bleeding gums\n\n– A high fever\n\nIf your child is experiencing any of these symptoms, it’s best to consult with a paediatric dentist as soon as possible. This is especially important if the symptoms persist for an extended period of time. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for ensuring that your child’s oral health is maintained and improved.\n\n#  How often should my child see a paediatric dentist?\n\nRegular check-ups with a paediatric dentist are important for children’s oral health. The recommended frequency of visits depends on a child’s age and stage of development.\n\nInfants and toddlers should see a paediatric dentist every six months, even if they have no visible problems with their teeth. This is because many oral health problems develop early on and may be undetectable without an examination. Paediatric dentists can monitor the eruption of teeth, spot early signs of tooth decay, and provide advice on oral hygiene habits.\n\nSchool-age children should visit a paediatric dentist every 12 months, or more frequently if they have any dental concerns. During these visits, the dentist will check for cavities, gum disease, and other problems. They will also offer guidance on proper brushing and flossing techniques.\n\nIt is important to remember that oral health is fundamental to overall health, so regular dental care is critical for children of all ages. For parents who are unsure of when to take their child for their first check-up, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends consulting your family dentist or paediatrician.","source":"_posts/What-is-paediatric-dentistry.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is paediatric dentistry\ndate: 2022-09-19 18:37:46\ncategories:\n- Dentist\ntags:\n- Dentist\n- dentist pediatrician\n- pediatric dentist\n- paediatric dentist\n- implants dentist\n- dentist insurances\n- dentist clinic\n- comfort dentist\n---\n\n\n#  What is paediatric dentistry?\n\n#\n\nPaediatric dentistry is the branch of dentistry that specialises in the care and treatment of children’s teeth.

It is a sub-specialty of paediatrics, which is the medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries in childhood.</p>\n<h1 id=\"-1\"><a href=\"#-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h1><p>Paediatric dentists have undergone special training in order to be able to provide dental care for children from birth right through to adolescence. They are experts in providing preventive dental care, as well as treating common childhood oral health problems such as tooth decay and gum disease.</p>\n<h1 id=\"-2\"><a href=\"#-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\"></a></h1><p>If you are looking for a dentist who can provide specialist care for your child’s teeth, then you should consider seeking out a paediatric dentist. Many general dentists also offer paediatric dental services, but it is best to check with them beforehand to ensure that they have experience in treating young patients.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-are-the-benefits-of-paediatric-dentistry\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-benefits-of-paediatric-dentistry\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the benefits of paediatric dentistry?\"></a>What are the benefits of paediatric dentistry?</h1><p>Children who have good oral health and receive dental care when they are young are more likely to have healthy teeth and gums as adults. Good oral health is important for overall health, and paediatric dentistry provides the necessary dental care for children.</p>\n<p>One benefit of paediatric dentistry is that it helps children develop a positive attitude towards dental care. When they are young, children should be seen by a paediatric dentist at least every six months. This will help them get used to visiting the dentist and having their teeth examined. Regular visits to the dentist can also help identify any potential problems early on, before they become serious.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of paediatric dentistry is that it can help prevent tooth decay and other oral health problems. Tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease, so it’s important to get your child’s teeth checked regularly by a paediatric dentist. By doing so, you can help prevent your child from developing cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems.</p>\n<p>If your child does need treatment for a dental problem, a paediatric dentist is equipped to provide it. Paediatric dentists have special training in treating children’s teeth and jaws, so they can provide the appropriate treatment for each child. This may include fillings, crowns, braces, or surgery if necessary.</p>\n<p>Overall, paediatric dentistry provides an important level of care for children’s oral health. It helps ensure that children have healthy teeth and gums which will last into adulthood.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-is-the-difference-between-paediatric-dentistry-and-regular-dentistry\"><a href=\"#What-is-the-difference-between-paediatric-dentistry-and-regular-dentistry\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is the difference between paediatric dentistry and regular dentistry?\"></a>What is the difference between paediatric dentistry and regular dentistry?</h1><p>When it comes to paediatric dentistry, there is a difference between what paediatric dentists and regular dentists can do. For one, paediatric dentists have two years of additional training focused on caring for children’s teeth. They are also certified by the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry.</p>\n<p>That means that paediatric dentists are experts in not only detecting and treating dental problems in children, but also in creating a positive experience for kids during their dental visits. They understand how to handle young patients and make them feel at ease.</p>\n<p>Paediatric dentists can also provide preventive care, such as fluoride treatments and dental sealants, which help protect children’s teeth from cavities. They can also provide guidance on how to care for your child’s teeth at home.</p>\n<p>If you have a child who needs dental care, it’s important to seek out a qualified paediatric dentist. A good place to start is the American Academy of Pediatrics website.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-do-I-know-if-my-child-needs-to-see-a-paediatric-dentist\"><a href=\"#How-do-I-know-if-my-child-needs-to-see-a-paediatric-dentist\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How do I know if my child needs to see a paediatric dentist?\"></a>How do I know if my child needs to see a paediatric dentist?</h1><p>There are various signs and symptoms which could suggest that your child needs to see a paediatric dentist.
