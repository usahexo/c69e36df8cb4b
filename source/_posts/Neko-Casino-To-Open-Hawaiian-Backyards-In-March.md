#  Neko Casino To Open Hawaiian Backyards In March

## Neko Casino is the new go-to spot for Hawaiian backyard gaming and entertainment, set to open in March of 2019. This casino is unlike any other on the island, as it will house a game room, arcade, and lounge area – perfect for hosting private events and parties.

Neko Casino has been in the works for over two years and is the brainchild of childhood friends Kainoa Flores and Marcus Yamasaki. The two got the idea for Neko Casino when they were out of town and couldn’t find a decent place to game and have fun with their friends. “We wanted to create a place where people could come and relax, have some fun, and escape from their everyday lives,” said Yamasaki.

The casino will be filled with your favorite classic casino games like blackjack, poker, and roulette; but it will also feature unique games specifically tailored to the Hawaiian community. These games include ‘ Ulaula (a traditional Hawaiian dice game), Mahi Mahi (an arcade game that simulates fishing), and Pūʻālua (a shuffleboard game).

In addition to gaming, Neko Casino will offer a variety of food options including pupus (appetizers), local favorites like plate lunch style meals, shave ice, coffee drinks, and more. There will also be a full bar serving cocktails, beer, wine, and sake.

Neko Casino is looking to become the go-to spot for all things gaming and entertainment in Hawaii. With its unique offerings tailored specifically to the Hawaiian community, there’s no doubt that Neko Casino will be a success. Make sure to check it out when it opens in March!

#  After Months Of Delays, Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino Is Now Open

After months of delays, Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino is now open. That's the good news. The bad news is that the casino is in the middle of nowhere, and it's a long drive from anywhere.

Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino is a small, one-story building located in the middle of a cow pasture. There's not much there except for the casino, a small bar, and a few picnic tables.

The casino has about 20 slot machines and a handful of blackjack and poker tables. It's not much, but it's enough to keep locals amused for a few hours.

The bar serves cold beers and mai tais, and the picnic tables are perfect for enjoying a nice breeze while watching the cows graze in the pasture.

The only downside is that it's a long drive from anywhere. The casino is located about 45 minutes from Hilo, and it's another 30 minutes to Kona. If you're not familiar with Hawaii, that may not seem like too bad of a drive, but if you're used to living in a big city, it can feel like forever.

Overall, Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino is a fun little place to kill some time. The only downside is its location, which makes it difficult to get to. But if you're ever in the area, it's well worth a visit.

#  Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino Is Now Fully Operational

Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino is now fully operational. Located in the heart of Waikiki, the casino features all your favorite classic casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and craps. In addition, there is a wide variety of slots and video poker machines.

The casino also offers a range of complimentary services, including free drinks while you play and valet parking. And if you're hungry, the casino has you covered with its own full-service restaurant.

So come on down to Neko's Hawaiian Backyards Casino and experience all the excitement and fun of a real casino without having to leave Waikiki!
