#  Slovenia hoping for lottery win with unprecedented number of balls

Ljubljana, Slovenia - In a move that could either spell financial disaster or riches beyond imagination, the Slovenian government has decided to increase the number of lottery balls in its next draw from 39 to 49.

"The potential payoff is too great to ignore," Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk said in announcing the change. "With an extra 10 balls, we have a much better chance of hitting the jackpot."

The government is hoping to raise as much as 100 million euros from the increased drawing, which is more than twice the amount it would take to bail out the country's troubled banks.

The decision has met with mixed reactions in Slovenia. Some people are excited at the prospect of winning a large sum of money, while others are worried that an increased number of balls will mean even more people losing their money.

"It's a gamble," economist Zdenka Kramar said of the decision. "But if enough people buy tickets, the government could come out ahead."

Whether they support it or not, most Slovenians agree that it will be interesting to see what happens when 49 balls are drawn instead of the usual 39.

The Slovenian roulette scene is heating up. The Alpine country located in Central Europe has 108 licensed casinos with roulette tables, making it one of the most concentrated gambling areas in the world.

Gambling critics say that this could lead to saturation and potential over-saturation of the market, leading to less revenue for the government in the future. But for now, the government is still raking in the profits, with a total of €577 million generated from gambling in 2016, up from €569 million in 2015.

This is due in part to the increasing popularity of online casino games, which now make up a significant portion of Slovenia's gambling economy. In fact, online gambling now accounts for more than half of all gambling revenues in Slovenia.

This trend can be seen throughout Europe as a whole, with online gambling revenues expected to reach $24.5 billion by 2020, according to a report by H2 Gambling Capital. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 8.5%.

What is behind this growth? One factor is that online casinos are typically much more accessible than brick-and-mortar casinos. They are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and players can access them from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

Another factor is that many online casinos offer generous bonuses and rewards programs that give players incentives to keep playing. These bonuses can amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars free play money when players sign up for new accounts.

#  Slovenia hoping to break even with 108 balls in roulette wheel

Ljubljana, Slovenia - Slovenia is a small country in Central Europe with a population of just over 2 million people. Despite its size, the country has been able to produce some of the world's best athletes, including tennis player Novak Djokovic and Formula One driver Primože Brezec. In addition, Slovenia has also been successful in other sports, such as basketball and alpine skiing.

One area where Slovenia has not had much success, however, is gambling. The country has not had a single casino open since it gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. This is about to change, however, as the Slovenian government has finally given the green light for two new casinos to open later this year.

The first casino will be located in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and is scheduled to open in September. The second casino will be located in Maribor, the second-largest city in Slovenia. It is not yet clear when this casino will open.

Both casinos will be operated by Austrian company Casinos Austria AG. The company already operates 21 casinos in eight other countries, including Croatia, Hungary, and Romania.

While there are no official figures available on how much revenue the casinos are expected to generate, industry experts believe that they could bring in as much as 10 million euros (approximately $11 million) a year. This would be a welcome addition to Slovenia's coffers, as the country posted a budget deficit of 2% of GDP last year.

The government says that it decided to allow casinos to open in order to help boost tourism. "We expect that the opening of new casinos will contribute significantly to increasing tourist traffic," said Matej Torkar, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economics. He added that "the development of tourism services is one of the priorities of our economic policy."

Critics say that allowing casinos to operate could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates among Slovenians. However, the government believes that it can curb such problems by imposing tight regulations on how the casinos operate. For example, gamblers will only be able to bet a maximum of 108 euros ($118) per spin on roulette wheels.

#  What will happen when 108 balls are put into play at the roulette wheel in Slovenia?

On July 13th, a casino in Slovenia will attempt to break the world record for the largest roulette wheel. The current record stands at 105 balls, which were put into play at the Star Casino in Dortmund, Germany in December of 2016.

The casino in Slovenia is expecting crowds of people come to watch as 108 balls are put into play on their roulette wheel. What will happen when they do?

Most likely, nothing out of the ordinary will happen. The odds of any particular ball being called are still 1 in 37, and even with 108 balls in play, the chances of a particular number being called are still very slim.

However, there is always the chance that something could go wrong. If all 108 balls landed on the same number, for example, the casino would be out a lot of money!

In order to break the current world record, the casino in Slovenia will need to successfully get all 108 balls onto the roulette wheel. This is no easy task – even with 105 balls it can be difficult to achieve!

One way or another, this wager should be an interesting one to watch. Whether or not anything happens out of the ordinary remains to be seen – but either way, it’s sure to be an exciting event!

#  Will Slovenia's gamble pay off with 108 balls in the roulette wheel?

The tiny European country of Slovenia made a big bet in May by becoming the first in the world to offer a legal, regulated online gambling market. The government is hoping that the move will bring in much needed revenue to help plug its budget deficit.

Slovenia's online gambling sector is currently estimated to be worth around €250 million per year, of which the state could take a cut of up to 17 percent. That could add up to as much as €42 million in revenue - a significant contribution to the country's annual budget of around €20 billion.

The new market is open to both locals and foreigners, and covers all types of gambling, including casino games, sports betting and poker. However, there are some restrictions - only people over 18 can play, and operators must be licensed by the government.

The launch has been met with mixed reactions. Some industry experts are skeptical that Slovenia will be able to attract enough players to make the market viable, while others argue that it will simply see an influx of players from elsewhere in Europe who are looking for a more reputable and safer online gaming experience.

One thing is for sure - the Slovenian government is taking a gamble with its new market. If it pays off, it could provide a major boost to the country's economy. But if it fails, taxpayers could be on the hook for millions of euros in lost revenue.
