#  What is the objective of the game?

Risk is a two-player board game that simulates the battle for world domination. The objective of the game is to conquer all of the territories on the board.

# How do you win?

The first player to conquer all of the territories on the board is declared the winner.

# What are the different types of pieces in the game?

There are five different types of pieces in Risk: armies, navies, air forces, missiles, and satellites. Armies are used to conquer territories, navies are used to attack ships, air forces are used to attack land targets, missiles are used to destroy opposing armies or navies, and satellites are used to monitor enemy movements.

# What are the different dice rolls?

There are six different dice rolls in Risk: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. These correspond to the number of armies that can be moved with a single roll. For example, a roll of 5 would allow the player to move five armies.

#  What animals can be found in the game?

The game has a wide variety of animals that players can encounter while exploring. Some of the most common animals include elk, deer, bison, coyotes, and bears. Players will also find a variety of birds, fish, and other small creatures in the game.

One of the most interesting things about the animal life in the game is how different it is from region to region. For example, elk are common in the forests of Oregon but much less common in the deserts of Nevada. Similarly, bears are more commonly found in the colder regions of the map while coyotes are more prevalent in warm areas.

This diversity makes exploring different parts of the map an interesting experience and provides players with a wealth of new creatures to encounter.

#  What are the power-ups in the game?

There are a plethora of power-ups in the game that can help you get ahead, and they come in all shapes and sizes. Some of the most common power-ups include coins, shields, and speed boosts. However, there are also power-ups that can transform you into other objects or creatures, such as a dragon or a fish. These power-ups can give you an edge in the game by helping you defeat your opponents or by simply making it easier for you to move around.

If you're looking to collect as many power-ups as possible, then you'll want to head over to the bonus levels. These levels are especially filled with power-ups, so make sure you take advantage of them. And, if you're lucky enough to snag a Super Star, then you'll become invincible for a brief period of time and be able to take out your opponents with ease.

So, what are you waiting for? Start collecting those power-ups and see how far they can take you!

#  How many levels are there in the game?

The number of levels in a game can vary, but is typically around 10-15. There are usually different levels of gameplay, starting with easier levels and progressing to more challenging ones. In addition, there may be bonus levels which are not essential to complete the game but offer an advantage if achieved.

#  Where is Burundi?

Burundi is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of East Africa, bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. The capital city is Bujumbura.

The Twa, Hutu, and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. The Hutu are the majority ethnicity, followed by the Tutsi and then the Twa.

Burundi was ruled by a series of kings and dictators from the early 1800s until 1962 when it became a republic. In 1966, following a military coup, Lieutenant-General Jean-Baptiste Bagaza assumed control of the country and ruled as president until 1987. He was succeeded by another military leader, Major Pierre Buyoya, who served until 1993 when he ceded power to Cyprien Ntaryamira of the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU). Ntaryamira was assassinated in 1994 and was succeeded by his vice president, Aristide Niyonkuru.

In April 2005 rebel forces led by Pierre Nkurunziza overthrew Niyonkuru's government; Nkurunziza subsequently won disputed elections in 2005 and 2010. Ethnic violence has continued throughout his rule. The 2015 Burundian unrest began on 26 April when military officers attempted a coup against President Nkurunziza while he was out of the country attending a summit in Tanzania; they were unsuccessful, but protests against Nkurunziza's third term erupted soon afterwards. On 13 May troops loyal to Nkurunziza fired into a crowd of protesters killing at least 37 people; between May and September more than 1,200 people were killed amid increasing reports of torture, rape, and executions by government forces.

In October 2017 lawmakers from Burundi's ruling party proposed changes to the constitution that would allow President Pierre Nkurunziza to run for a fourth term in 2020; on 25 November 2017 parliament passed a bill allowing him to do so.
