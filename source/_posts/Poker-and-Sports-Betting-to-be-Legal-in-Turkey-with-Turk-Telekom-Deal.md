#  Poker and Sports Betting to be Legal in Turkey with Turk Telekom Deal


The Turkish government has reached an agreement with Turk Telekom to make all forms of gambling, including poker and sports betting, legal in the country. The move is expected to generate up to $1 billion in tax revenue each year.

Under the agreement, Turk Telekom will take a 25% stake in the newly created Gaming and Sports Betting Authority. The new authority will be responsible for regulating all forms of gambling in Turkey, including online and land-based casinos, poker, and sports betting.

The deal is seen as a major win for Turk Telekom, which has been struggling to compete with global telecommunications giants such as AT&T and Verizon. The company's share prices have risen by over 6% on news of the agreement.

The Turkish government expects the new gambling laws to generate up to $1 billion in annual tax revenue. This money will be used to fund education and infrastructure projects, as well as social services programs.

Supporters of the deal say that it will help to reduce crime and increase tourism in Turkey. They argue that making gambling legal will give Turkish citizens greater access to safe and responsible gambling options.

Opponents of the deal say that it will lead to an increase in problem gambling rates in Turkey. They argue that the government should focus on other issues, such as corruption and unemployment, rather than legalizing gambling.

#  Poker, Sports Betting to be Separated in Turkey with Turk Telekom Deal

Turk Telekom, the Turkish telecommunications company, is set to become the first licensed provider of legal online poker and sports betting in Turkey. The move comes as part of an agreement between the company and the Turkish government which will see the two industries separated in order to prevent gambling addiction.

According to Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, the move is designed to protect citizens from the dangers of gambling addiction. "The reason we are making this distinction is to protect our people from harmful addictions," he said. "Gambling addiction is a social problem that can have very serious consequences."

The new arrangement will see Turk Telekom become the exclusive provider of online poker and sports betting in Turkey, while other operators will be banned from offering these services. The agreement is expected to be finalised within the next few weeks.

This development could have a significant impact on the online gambling industry in Turkey. Turk Telekom is well-positioned to take a leading role in the market, given its strong brand name and extensive network of retail stores across the country. Other operators may find it difficult to compete, especially as they are now prohibited from offering online poker and sports betting services.

It remains to be seen whether this move will have a positive or negative impact on Turkish citizens. On one hand, it could help protect them from the dangers of gambling addiction. On the other hand, it could limit their access to safe and legal gambling services.

#  Poker and Sports Betting Likely to be Legalized in Turkey with Turk Telekom Deal 

# The landmark deal between the Turkish government and Turk Telekom is expected to pave the way for the legalisation of poker and sports betting in the country.

The new agreement, which was finalised on Sunday, will see Turk Telekom invest a total of $4.5 billion in Turkey over the next three years. In turn, the Turkish government will reduce its stake in the company from 51% to 30%.

The move is expected to benefit the Turkish economy, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying that it will create 100,000 jobs. It is also likely to lead to the legalisation of poker and sports betting in Turkey, as the government looks to boost tax revenues from these activities.

Poker has been illegal in Turkey since September 2013, when then-prime minister Erdogan signed a decree forbidding all forms of gambling other than those organised by the state-owned Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Milli Piyango Idaresi (Turkish National Lottery).

Sports betting has been similarly prohibited in Turkey since April 2011, when then-sports minister Suat Kilic issued a decree prohibiting all forms of sports betting except those offered by state-owned TAKASBANK.

#  Poker, Sports Betting to be Allowed in Turkey with Turk Telekom Deal

_According to the Hurriyet Daily News, the Turkish government is preparing to allow poker and sports betting as part of a new deal with Turk Telekom. The new agreement would give the telecoms operator a monopoly on such services._

The move is being made as part of an effort to raise money for the government. It’s thought that the proceeds from the gambling services would be used to help fund infrastructure projects.

Under the proposed deal, Turk Telekom would be given exclusive rights to offer both poker and sports betting in Turkey. This would include online and offline services.

The government has been looking for ways to increase revenue in recent months. It’s thought that this new agreement could bring in up to $2 billion annually.

This isn’t the first time that Turk Telekom has been involved in gambling services in Turkey. The company has offered a variety of lottery products for many years.

It’s not clear yet when the new agreement will go into effect. However, it’s expected that it will happen soon.
