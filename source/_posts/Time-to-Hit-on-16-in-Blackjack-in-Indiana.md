Whether you’re a Hoosier looking to charm your crush on “First Kiss Friday” or just want to know how to pick up someone in general, this guide will teach you everything you need to know about flirting in the state of Indiana.

First things first: what should you wear? You don’t want to dress too provocatively but you also don’t want to be underdressed. Something in the middle is best, like a modest dress or jeans and a cute top.

Now that you look your best, it’s time to start flirting! Here are some tips:

#1: Make eye contact. This is one of the most important things when it comes to flirting – if you can make eye contact and hold it for a few seconds, the other person will take notice.

#2: Smile. A smile is always sure to put someone at ease and make them feel good, which is key when you’re trying to flirt with them.

#3: Be positive. No one wants to talk to someone who’s always negative – focus on the good things and be upbeat and fun.

#4: Be yourself. This is probably the most important piece of advice – if you try to be someone you’re not, it will show and the other person won’t be interested. Just be yourself and let your personality shine through.

Once you start flirting, it’s important to know when to stop. Make sure not to come across as too aggressive or else the other person will likely back away. If they seem interested, continue flirting but dial it back a bit if they start getting uncomfortable. And above all else, have fun!

#  How to Play Blackjack in Indiana: When to Hit on 16

In Indiana, casinos that offer blackjack tables allow players to hit on 16, while in other states, hitting on 16 is not allowed. Learning when to hit and stand can improve your chances of winning at blackjack. If you are dealt two cards of the same rank, such as two eights, you can split the cards to create two separate hands. When splitting a hand, you must place an equal bet on each hand. If you are dealt a two card total of 10 or 11, you should hit if the dealer has a card of 2 through 9 showing. If the dealer has a ten or ace showing, you should stand. If you are dealt a two card total of 3 or 4, you should hit against any dealer upcard except an ace. If the dealer has an ace showing, you should surrender (i.e., give up) your hand rather than risk losing more money.
