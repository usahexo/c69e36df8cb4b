#  Indiana Becomes Fifth State to Legalize Sports Gambling

In a 5-4 ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) is unconstitutional. The law, which was passed in 1992, made it illegal for states to "sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize" sports betting.

The case before the court was brought by New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize sports gambling since 2009. In 2012, New Jersey passed a law permitting sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but the major professional sports leagues and the NCAA sued to stop it.

The Court's majority opinion was written by Justice Samuel Alito Jr., who said that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state sovereignty. "Congress can regulate interstate commerce," Alito wrote. "But if it wishes to regulate state policymaking in this area," he continued, "it must do so in a manner that does not interfere with the sovereign authority of the States."

Justice Anthony Kennedy joined with the four more liberal justices in concurring with the majority opinion. Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts Jr., Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan dissented.

With Monday's ruling, states are now free to decide whether they want to legalize sports gambling. So far, five states have done so: Nevada, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, and now Indiana. Several other states are considering similar legislation.

"It's huge," former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said of Monday's ruling. "New Jersey has been battling for its rights for seven years ... I'm thrilled for the people of New Jersey."

#  Indiana Moves to Legalize Sports Betting in Response to Nevada




In a move that would legalize sports betting in the state of Indiana, lawmakers there are looking to follow in the footsteps of Nevada. Republican State Rep. Alan Harper, who is leading the effort to legalize sports betting in Indiana, says that it could bring in as much as $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. This comes as response to the fact that Nevada has seen a surge in revenue from sports betting in the past few years, with over $4 billion being wagered on sporting events in 2017 alone.

The proposed law would allow licensed casinos and racetracks in Indiana to offer betting on professional and collegiate sporting events. It would also allow for mobile betting and internet gambling, something that is currently not allowed under Indiana law. In addition to bringing in new revenue, supporters of legalized sports betting say that it would create jobs and help boost tourism in the state.

Opponents of the measure, however, argue that it could lead to increased addiction rates and other social ills. They also maintain that it is a form of gambling that should be left to the states where it is already legal.

Despite the opposition, it looks likely that Indiana will soon join Nevada in legalizing sports betting. Lawmakers there are expected to take up the issue early next year.

#  Indiana Follows Nevada's Lead, Legalizing Sports Gambling

On Tuesday, May 15th, the Indiana state legislature voted to legalize sports gambling in the state. This move follows a similar decision by the Nevada state legislature in February of this year.

This move is seen as a way for states to generate revenue from what has previously been a black market industry. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that Americans illegally bet more than $150 billion on sports each year.

Indiana's new law allows for licensed casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. Bettors will be able to place wagers on domestic and international sporting events, including professional and collegiate games.

It is not yet clear how much revenue Indiana stands to generate from legalized sports gambling, but it is estimated that the Nevada market is worth $500 million annually. This number could grow as other states follow Nevada's lead in legalizing sports betting.

The AGA released a statement applauding Indiana's decision, stating that "this legislation will protect consumers, promote responsible gaming and help make Indiana an attractive location for businesses looking to provide legal sports betting."

Opponents of legalized sports gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, supporters argue that such problems already exist with other forms of gambling, such as casino games and lotteries. They argue that legalization will allow for better regulation of the industry and provide additional revenue for states and municipalities.

#  Indiana Moves Quickly to Legalize Sports Betting After Nevada

LAS VEGAS - Governor Eric Holcomb signed a bill into law on Wednesday legalizing sports betting in Indiana, just two days after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to legalize the activity.

Indiana is the seventh state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court's decision, joining Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. A total of 24 states have now introduced legislation to allow sports betting.

"This is a great day for Hoosiers and our economy," Governor Holcomb said in a statement. "Allowing sports betting will bring new revenues to the state and create jobs."

Under the new law, Indiana residents age 21 or older will be able to place bets on professional and collegiate sporting events at licensed casinos or online. The Indiana Gaming Commission will oversee regulation of the industry.

Initial estimates project that sports betting could generate up to $50 million in annual revenue for the state. That figure could increase if more states legalize sports betting, as expected.

The American Gaming Association (AGA), a casino lobbying group, said that legalized sports betting could generate as much as $250 billion in annual revenue nationwide.

#  Indiana Joins Nevada in Legalizing Sports Gambling

In a landmark decision on Monday, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that bans gambling on sporting events. The law had been in place since 1992. The ruling paves the way for states to legalize sports betting.

Indiana was one of the first states to announce its intention to move forward with legalization. Nevada, which has a long history of legal gambling, was the first state to implement sports betting after the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. Supporters contend that regulation will lead to better protections for consumers. They also argue that sports betting is a harmless pastime for many people and that it should be legal for adults to participate in.

The legality of sports betting is likely to be a hot topic in the upcoming elections. Several states, including New York and Massachusetts, are considering legalizing it.
